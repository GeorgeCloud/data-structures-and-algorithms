# Quick Sort Algorithm
The quick sort algorithm is sorts an unsorted array by using a pivot that is
used to compare the value inside the array to create two sides of array to get
a Big O notation of O(n log n) time.

## Challenge
Sort an unsorted array of numbers in a Big-O-Notation of O(n log n).
Validate if it is already sorted before sorting.
Sort an almost sorted array.
