# Radix Sort Algorithm
The algorithm sorts an unordered array using the radix sort method. It creates
10 buckets for every natural number from 0 to 9. Is uses these buckets to loop
through an unsorted array and inserts them in order into their appropriate bucket
depending on their last digit value.

## Challenge
Handle unsorted arrays.
Handle already sorted array.
Handle Invalid User Input.

## Solution
